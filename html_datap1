    <h3>5.7 Right to Withdraw Consent</h3>
    <p>Where the processing of personal data is based on the User's consent, the User has the right to withdraw their consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out prior to withdrawal.</p>

    <h3>7.3 Third-Party Integrations and APIs</h3>

Additionally, multi-factor authentication (MFA) is employed for all accounts with administrative access to further strengthen security.</p>
    
    <h3>8.3 Incident Response and Data Breach Procedures</h3>
    <p>In the event of a data breach or security incident, the service has an established incident response plan to quickly detect, contain, and mitigate the impact.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Notification to Authorities:</strong> If required, the service will notify the relevant supervisory authorities within 72 hours of becoming aware of a breach.</li>
      <li><strong>Notification to Users:</strong> If the breach is likely to result in a high risk to the User's rights and freedoms, affected Users will be notified promptly with details about the breach and the measures taken.</li>
      <li><strong>Investigation and Remediation:</strong> A full investigation will be conducted, and any necessary remediation steps, including technical fixes or enhanced security measures, will be implemented to prevent future breaches.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>9. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    
    <h3>9.1 Types of Cookies Used</h3>
    <p>The service uses the following types of cookies to enhance User experience:</p>

    <h2>10. AI-Specific Data Considerations</h2>
    
    <h3>10.1 How AI Processes User Data</h3>
    <p>The AI-powered chatbot processes User data to generate responses and improve service quality. This processing may involve:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Understanding and interpreting User queries to provide relevant responses.</li>
      <li><strong>Context Retention:</strong> Temporarily storing conversation history to maintain context within a session.</li>
      <li><strong>Service Optimization:</strong> Analyzing interactions to enhance AI accuracy and functionality while ensuring compliance with data protection laws.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>AI processing is designed to operate within the limits of GDPR regulations, and personal data is handled securely.</p>
    
    <h3>10.2 AI Training and Anonymization Practices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anonymization:</strong> Where possible, data used for AI training is anonymized to prevent the identification of individual Users.</li>
      <li><strong>Aggregated Learning:</strong> AI model improvements are based on aggregated patterns and trends rather than individual conversations.</li>
      <li><strong>User Control:</strong> The User may request that their interactions are not used for AI training by contacting the service provider.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>10.3 Limitation of Automated Decision-Making (Art. 22 GDPR)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The service does not use AI for fully automated decision-making that produces legal effects or significantly impacts the User without human intervention.</li>
      <li>If automated decision-making is used in any capacity, the User will be informed about its presence, significance, and consequences, and will have the right to request human review of decisions that affect them.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>11. Complaints and Contact Information</h2>
    
    <h3>11.1 How to File a Complaint</h3>
    <p>The User has the right to file a complaint if they believe their personal data has been mishandled or if the service provider has not complied with GDPR regulations. Complaints can be submitted via:</p>

      <li>Postal Address: August-Bebel-Str. 89 – Haus 7, 14482 Potsdam.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>11.2 Supervisory Authority Contact (German Data Protection Authority - BfDI)</h3>
    <p>If the User is not satisfied with the resolution of their complaint, they have the right to contact the relevant data protection authority. In Germany, this is the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Website: https://www.bfdi.bund.de</li>
      <li>Phone: +49 (0)228 997799-0</li>
      <li>Address: Der Bundesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz und die Informationsfreiheit (BfDI)<br>Graurheindorfer Str. 153, 53117 Bonn, Germany</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>12. Policy Updates and Changes</h2>
    
    <h3>12.1 Right to Modify the Policy</h3>
    <p>The service provider reserves the right to update or modify this Data Protection and Privacy Policy at any time to reflect legal requirements, technological advancements, or changes in business practices. Any changes will be made in compliance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
    
    <h3>12.2 Notification of Changes</h3>
    <p>Users will be informed of significant changes to this policy through appropriate channels, such as: A notice on the service's website or platform, direct email notifications (if applicable), and a pop-up notification upon login.
